## Introction to Grasping
This course concentrates on a robotic hand unlike a gripper. The contents are from DoF to kinematics about a robotc hand. A project of the course dealt with glove inputs from humand hand to control a robotic hand in simulation.

## Robotics Hackathon
We designed a robotic hand for Siemens. I took simulation part from sense glove inputs. We utilize Unity with ROS. I made a simple game to test our sensor inputs to outputs.
