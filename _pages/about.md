## Hi! :smile:  I am Mars

### There are a couple of reasons why I use this name. First my Korean name sounds like Mars and second my characteristic is similar to person who comes from Mars. This is because I always try to change paradigm and system. Currently, I am focusing on robotics.

### Thank you for reading my introduction. I hope today will be another good day for you.
